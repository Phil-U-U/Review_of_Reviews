# Review_of_Reviews

Motivation:
The ratings from users who have consumed the products act as a good reference for future buyers. However, direct average of ratings without considering the trustability of ratings are less valuable than a quantified rating score considering the quality of reviews. This project provides a summarized rating score which integrate the quality of reviews for each individual book sold by Amazon, to help potential readers decide which books to buy.
